# Part-Time-Masters-Course-Scheduling-System

## Project Description
This project introduces an innovative course scheduling system for part-time masters programs, leveraging the power of genetic algorithms to optimize schedules based on real-life data. The primary goal of this system is to efficiently allocate courses, considering various constraints and preferences, to create an effective timetable that caters to the unique needs of part-time masters students.
